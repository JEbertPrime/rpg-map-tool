## rpg-map-tool (name pending)
A simple tool to organize all of your TRPG notes and maps together, and graphically display that data. Limited functionality now, but here's a list of some features that are currently implemented and will hopefully be implemented in the future.
### features
 - [x] Upload maps and overlay a hex grid
 - [x] Paint colors onto these maps to group hexes by commonalities
 - [x] Nest colors for greater levels of detail
 - [ ] Nest maps
 - [x] Add notes to either a hex or color (notes are nested with color layers)
 - [x] Persist map data to server
 - [ ] Create shared maps and control which hexes/information your audience can see
 - [ ] Calculate travel time between hexes based on distance, terrain     
 and whatever else I/you can think of!
